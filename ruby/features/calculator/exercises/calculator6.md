# Multiplication
We would like our calculator to be able to multiply numbers.
Write a new user story for this feature and create a new scenario file with an `@calculator` and `@wip` tags.

You will need to update the `Calculator` class to get this working. When you are done
***remember to remove the `@wip` tag!***

We just learned that our calculator display can only handle 20 character. We want the
calculator to automatically switch to scientific notation when the result would be more
that 20 characters.

Write a new user story for this feature and create a new scenario file with an `@calculator` and `@wip` tags.

You will need to update the `Calculator` class to get this working. When you are done
***remember to remove the `@wip` tag!***

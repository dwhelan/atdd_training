# Add successive numbers
We would like our calculator to be able to remember the result so we can chain
additions together:

* I add `2` and `2` and get `4`
* then I can add `2` again and get `6`

Write a new user story for this feature and create a new `.feature` file with an `@calculator` and `@wip` tags.

You will need to update the `Calculator` class to get this working. When you are done
***remember to remove the `@wip` tag!***

# Split up compound steps
Generally, when you notice the word `and` in step definition
it is smell that the step is doing too much.
If we split the step definition into two parts and use the
built-in `And` gherkin keyword, then the new smaller steps
are often more reusable.

Update the `Add two numbers (split up the add step into two separate steps)`
so that it works.

***Remember to remove the `@wip` tag!***

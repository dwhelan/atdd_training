# RubyMine
[RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) is recommended due to its excellent refactoring and test support.
If you don't have RubyMine installed you can download a 30 day trial version [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/download/).

#### Running tests from the IDE
Within RubyMine you can right click on any `.feature` file and select `Run...`.

#### Markdown support
To view the kata descriptions it is recommended that you install the **Markdown support** RubyMine plugin.
Refer to [Enabling and Disabling Plugins](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/2016.2/enabling-and-disabling-plugins.html) if you need help with this.
